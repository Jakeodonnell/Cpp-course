C++ assignments.

First assignemnt contains code that gives an understanding for how arguments are used in C++. Mostly code used to learn how compiling, linking and other c++ terminal comands are used. 

Second assignment a C++ program was written in order to implement:
1.C-array containing only prime numbers from two to N.
2.String manipulation, substituting specific parts of a string with another. 
3.Same as above but using std::string
3.Same as above but using char*

Third assignment a C++ program was written in order to implement a personregister including two classes and one test program. The class "Person" contains name and adress. The class PersonReg contains the register.

Fourth assignemnt included the STL in order to implement some algorithms by using the included algorithms and containers in STL.

The fifth assignemnt was creating our own string class. 

The sixth assignment was creating our own interpreter for a language we called C@(cat.. ha.. ha). the assignemnt applys the interpreter pattern to implement an operatorprecedence parser.
